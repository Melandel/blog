**"Good Enough"** is often the driving philosophy at the workplace - that's reasonable. But it also means people who go for _"Highest Level of Craft"_ cannot improve correctly at the workplace.

Hi!

> Do you feel _agile_?  
Do you feel _proud_ of the codebase you're working on?  
What's your idea about how far (or close) you are from the _state of the art_?  
Do you _trust_ the code you read?  
What are three _positive_ things your codebase inspires to you?

These are some of the questions I have in my head.

I'm a French engineer with 4 years of experience in web development at the time of writing - mainly back-end, with .NET.

I've just spent a bit more than **1 year** working on **customizing my desktop environment** to reach a **workflow** that I can call _efficient_. I'm starting to feel comfortable with what I've made, so I thought it was a good opportunity to share some things about that **experience**.

I'll also post things related to **software craftmanship**, **agile software development** and **soft skills** - I enjoy thinking about these, though I gladly admit that I am far from mastering them. Here's a non-exhaustive list of **topics** I am likely to blog about:
* web programming
* resources available for learning
* unit tests
* architecture
* clean code
* code reviewing
* living documentation
* bringing change into your team or organization
* non-violent communication
* dealing with frustration at work
* mindset
* workflow
* command line tooling
* vim (yeah, the text editor)

But first, allow me to dedicate my first post(s) to that one year I spent tweaking my **workflow** in such a way that I now feel _in harmony with my IDE..._
